THIS WONT WORK RIGHT NOW!!!

harness json diffing powa in the terminal

The point
---------

Diff json objects in the terminal. 

TODO:
- read from stdin
- write diff to file
- append diff to file
- put diff on stdout (for use in pipes)
- connect jsdiff to couchdb. The idea would be to follow a document. Any changes are be diffed and written, appended, or piped somewhere
